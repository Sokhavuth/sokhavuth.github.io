Qiqige, a long-tune singer, came to Beijing to develop. Her husband Batu, who was a veterinarian, could only work in a horse riding club. One day, the club bought a rare Mongolian horse. Batu insisted on buying it and wanted to release it to nature. Conflicting with his personality, Batu was suddenly involved in a car accident when he went out. The pain of losing her husband caused Qi Qige to suddenly lose her voice during the performance. After buying the Mongolian horse, she drove back to the grassland alone and decided to end her life. Eji tried every means to persuade him, but he couldn't make Qige get out of his grief. At this time, the female camel of Eji's family died, and the camel lamb was dying without milk. In order to save the lamb, Erji and Qiqige decided to find a female camel to be its mother. The village head gave the female camel to Eji, but the female camel refused to feed the lamb, so Eji sang a long tune. During the singing, the female camel gradually relaxed, and the lamb was ready to eat milk. At this time, Eji had no strength to sing, and Qiqige continued to sing. She was surprised to find that she could sing long tunes again.
