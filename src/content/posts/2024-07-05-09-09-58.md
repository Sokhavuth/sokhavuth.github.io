In Inner Mongolia, there is a small village of Yushuwan, where Mongolian and Han people live together, next to the Mausoleum of Genghis Khan. In the 1970s, during the time when supplies were scarce, Daxiang and his friends enjoyed a happy childhood. Daxiang has three good friends, Jingui, Lide and Tara. The four boys secretly drink the milk of the cows in the team, bully the female students who are good in the class, and accidentally set the team on fire. No matter how hard the years are, children of the age who hate dogs can't feel it. Those childhood memories, one by one, piece by piece, are pieced together in fragments to form a unique texture of the age.

This year, a major event happened in Yushuwan. A railway under construction will go directly to Beijing through Yushuwan. Every production team in the commune is vying for the number of migrant workers who repair the railway, because the road construction team gives five times as many work points as the production team. In "Going to Beijing by Train", the construction of the railway connects the contradictions of the whole village, the family and the children's childhood. kind of dream. Whether for children or teachers, Beijing is a place that people yearn for.
