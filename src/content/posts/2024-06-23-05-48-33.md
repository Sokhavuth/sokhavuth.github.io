The movie tells the story of Du Liniang wandering in the back garden and dreaming that a young scholar came to court her. The two met in the Peony Pavilion and fell in love in the dream. At the same time, the scholar Liu Mengmei also dreamed that there was a beautiful woman standing under the plum tree in a garden, saying that she was destined to be married to him, and since then embarked on the road of dream-seeking.
