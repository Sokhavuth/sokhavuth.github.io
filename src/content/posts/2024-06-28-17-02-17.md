"I'm an Alien" takes Tianyou, a child who likes to fantasize all day long, as the main character. He attaches gentle and deep humanistic care to his childhood dreams, takes music as the core clue, and uses the combination of Xintianyou and the most popular modern music elements. An inspirational story that shows the spiritual pursuit of freedom and optimism, and finally realizes the dream.

Producer Zhao Guoqiang is an authentic Shaanxi film and television producer. Because he has a deep complex with the loess culture, his dream has always been to shoot a film about his hometown and folk songs in northern Shaanxi.

Like the title of the film, its creation process is also full of surprises. Zhao Guoqiang expressed his feelings: "It was really a twists and turns, and it was a very tormenting process. But what is interesting is that Tan Hua has a profound musical background and is a rare crossover director, and the screenwriter Wei Ling is also a person full of childlike fun and dreams. It was born for this script! I believe this is the arrangement of fate." The three finally worked out the new version that is full of traditional folk songs and modern music elements such as R&B and rock.
