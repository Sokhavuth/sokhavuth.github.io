An active basketball player, Han Jianshe, unfortunately injured his leg during a basketball match and eventually became disabled. After retiring, he came to a small remote mountain village and became a substitute PE teacher. His past glory in the basketball team did not bring him luck in his new life. Instead, he suffered repeated setbacks and fell into a trough in his life.
<br/><br/>
However, with his dedication to basketball and his love for children, he finally regained his confidence and hope. With a strong body and a strong will, he taught by precepts and deeds, so that a group of pure-natured but almost naughty mountain village elementary school students experienced the tempering of the "Dream Team", and finally ascended to the championship throne and won the honor of the whole team to visit the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Childhood dream.
