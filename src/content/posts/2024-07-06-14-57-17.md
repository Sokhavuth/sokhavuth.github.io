Sun Zuyao (played by Yue Xiaobing) died tragically in prison, and several officials related to him also died. Di Bafang (played by Liuguancheng) was ordered to thoroughly investigate the case, and he only had seven days. Li Shaobai (played by Han Shuo) and Zhao Linger (played by Li Meihui) launched an investigation, and unexpectedly found that the villains in the martial arts unexpectedly gathered in the Zuixian Tower one after another. What kind of conspiracy is brewing here?
<br/><br/>
It turned out that the villains were threatened by a mysterious figure called the ghost, and poisoned by him, in order to coerce them to work for him. At the same time, Lan Pozi (played by Liu Chenxia), the leader of the five poisons, also appeared in Zuixianlou. She is the Worst Ghost's greatest enemy. A melee of demons dancing wildly kicked off in Zuixian Tower, and when the urging ghost finally died, Zhao Ling'er discovered a fatal loophole, and the real murderer was still hidden in the darkness.
