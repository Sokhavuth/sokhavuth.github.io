The Zhangjinggao Yangtze River Bridge, the largest suspension bridge under construction globally, has made significant progress. Located in Jiangsu Province, China, the bridge spans 30 kilometers with a cross-river section stretching 7,859 meters. Its remarkable features include the world's largest span, highest cable tower, and largest ground wall anchorage foundation. It will be the first in China to achieve a 2,000-meter span, marking a significant advancement in China's bridge construction. Despite the complex hydrological conditions and technological challenges, careful planning and construction management have facilitated the success of this world-class super project. Expected to complete by October 2028, it will significantly enhance the region's transportation network, bridging the north and the south of the Yangtze River.
