Gouwa's peaceful and boring life like stagnant water was broken by a dumb girl who was suddenly shoveled out one day when he was feeding the cows. The dumb girl's every move is full of weirdness, in Erya's eyes the dumb girl is a fairy sister, Gouwa can't laugh or cry. Gouwa is in trouble! He has to choose between Erfeng, who has always liked him since he was a child, and the mute girl. Zhou Gong'an began to intervene in the investigation but it has been fruitless. Through the doctor Gouwa, he learned the secret of the dumb girl. Gouwa did not back down. Believe that love can melt everything. By the picturesque lake on the mountain, Gouwa's love finally paid off: the dumb girl spoke! However, the first sentence she spoke was "I killed someone".
