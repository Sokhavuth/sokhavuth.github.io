In 1947, with the continuous advancement of artillery fire, Yangquan was liberated, and the Communist Party of China established its own city on the ruins, becoming the first people's city established under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The whole film takes the construction of the city as the main line, with the elimination of enemy agents and personal emotions as the secondary line, and narrates the liberation and construction of Yangquan as a reference for other cities across the country. It has shaped the spirit of revolutionary heroism shown by the Communists represented by Ren Gong and Liu Shuihe in the process of building the people's city, and the responsibility of not forgetting the original intention and keeping in mind the mission.
