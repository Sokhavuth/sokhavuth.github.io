The earthquake was about to hit, and Malaysia was instigated by Yaoji to participate in gambling, but he lost all his property. He became angry and beat Yaoji and his wife who set up the situation, and was sentenced to prison. Unwilling to be reformed in prison, Malaysia cheated him of the chance to be released on medical parole. Unexpectedly, an earthquake struck at this time. Da Ma and the prison guard Xiao Li competed to save people, but Xiao Li was unfortunately smashed and seriously injured. Before he died, he told Da Ma to return to the prison for reform. Da Ma learned that his wife was killed and his youngest son was missing, and hoped to find his son before serving his sentence. Xiao Li's father was an old policeman, and he began to secretly track Da Ma. Sister Song was suffering from cancer. She believed in the Mayan prophecy, so Malaysia's son was adopted by her and named Noah. Lao Li helped Da Ma find his son, but Noah did not recognize him as his father. In the battle with Sister Song for the son, Da Ma fell in love with him. Because Noah suffered from the aftermath of the earthquake, Aizi was eager to raise money for his son to build a "Ya Ya Ark" that could shelter his soul. At this moment, Yaoji appeared.
