The lonely disabled girl takes paper-cutting as a companion, but unfortunately, the day after tomorrow, the family becomes more impoverished, changing a life that was originally full of hope. She has become a dispensable person in the village, and even at home makes her feel at a loss. The small piece of paper relieves the girl's loneliness and melancholy, but what the girl cut out is a story of hope in one's heart.
