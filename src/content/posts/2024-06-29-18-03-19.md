This film is adapted from real people and real events. The prototype of the story comes from the touching deeds of students in Class 93 (01) of the Fruit Tree Department of Hebei Agricultural University taking care of their parents who died of illness for 15 years. The protagonist, Li Baoyang, passed away suddenly due to illness during the Mood for Love. In order to comfort the deceased and support the parents of the deceased, this group of brothers and sisters with different surnames stick together to an eternal agreement-the old and the old.

The bits and pieces of the past 15 years are connected by a conscience bet. This bet made by the village director who believes in people's hearts and integrity and Liu Qu'er who sees through the warmth and coldness of human feelings is also one of the highlights of this drama. In the end, Liu Qu'er lost, but he sang "One Promise, Thousand Gold, Beauty and Fame" on the stage. And the "Good Deeds Hebei" written by this group with true feelings also resounded through the land of Yanzhao, warming everyone.
