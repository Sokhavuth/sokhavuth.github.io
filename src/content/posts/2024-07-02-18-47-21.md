The prototype of the protagonist of the film "It's Always Spring" is Wang Leyi, Party Secretary of Sanyuanzhu Village, Shouguang City, Shandong Province. He is known as the "father of vegetables in winter-warm greenhouses". The 30 years of China's reform and opening up are also the 30 years when he led the villagers to change their thinking and get rich. He has cancer and cannot be affected. But after being elected as the village party secretary by the villagers, he is determined to change the backwardness of his hometown within his limited life. His hometown has become rich and has become the largest winter warm vegetable base in northern China, and his life has also been sublimated in the process of struggle. The film is one of the 10 outstanding domestic films recommended by the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television to commemorate the 30th anniversary of reform and opening up to major theaters and the public across the country.
