E-sports player Xiao Cang loses in a game and decides to retire to engage in commercial activities. Later, due to the crisis of endorsement, Xiao Cang went to "Antarctic Town" to find the formula of "Fantasy Meat Muffins", and ran into Wang Ze who was hit by unemployment on the same day and returned to his hometown. In order to help his father pay off his debts, Wang Ze had to organize a team to defeat the bully Zhao Jinfa's team in the national competition, so he recruited his teammates - Jin William, the second generation rich man in the small town, Jia Zhuangzhuang, the only boy in the Nursing College, Ouyang Nan, a rebellious young girl and Single mother Gao Xue. The experience and determination of the five touched Xiao Cang, so Xiao Cang decided to guide their training as a coach, hoping to lead these "bottom players" to the road of counterattack.
