In a small town in the late Qing Dynasty, the catcher Song Yunshen and the catcher Hu Dianyuan were originally brothers and sisters who worshipped in Xingyimen since childhood. In cracking a robbery case, Song discovered the corrupt clues that Hu Changnian colluded with corrupt officials and robbers, causing the two to turn against each other. Song Yunshen adhered to the style of Xingyi Quan to punish evildoers and eliminate evil, and created the story of the half-step collapse boxing trick in deep prison.
