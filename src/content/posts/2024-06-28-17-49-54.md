This film is based on high school classes in Xinjiang in the Mainland. By telling the stories of students of all ethnic groups in the high class studying, living and growing up in the Mainland, it vividly demonstrates the kind care of the party and the state for the young people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. The Xinjiang children studying in the inner high class reflect the real living conditions of the people of all ethnic groups in the land of Xinjiang, who are united, progressing and prospering together.
