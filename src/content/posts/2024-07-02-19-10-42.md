A youth inspirational film about a pair of separated brothers in Putian South Shaolin who learn martial arts in their different living environments.
<br/><br/>
Brother Xiaojie lost his way and was separated from his family when he was a child, and was adopted by a martial arts coach. He lived a simple life since he was a child, and practiced martial arts every day very hard. He was a top student in his class. His younger brother Xiaolong has a good life and has loved kung fu since he was a child. His biggest dream is to become a national martial arts champion in the future, but he is not good at studying and is afraid of suffering. Because of the loss of a child, his mother doted on Xiaolong very much. The naughty Xiaolong often messed up the house, and his angry father sent him to practice martial arts in the martial arts gym where his brother was. The two people with very different living environments and personalities became competitors. They competed everywhere in study and life, and the two brothers staged humorous incidents at school. During the period, there were misunderstandings, kidnapping due to the gambling debts of the second uncle, etc., but all were resolved with the concerted efforts of the brothers with their own kung fu and wisdom.
