Bai Jingjing, an older strong woman, is glamorous. At a blind date meeting, Zhao Shuai, a son of a rich family, was overwhelmed by her charm, and rejected her initiative to strike up a conversation. Unwilling, he tried his best to launch a love offensive, but the result was a fiasco. The opera idiot Jiujiu wrote and played five girls with very different personalities, and the nerd Jiang Xiaoyu made a "subway flash date" with her under the command of his mother's remote control, and staged a blind date comedy that couldn't laugh or cry. Seeing this scene, Boy Scout, who had failed in blind dates frequently, was immediately attracted by the weird Jiujiu. The former Boy Scout was complained by the woman because he was too shrewd in the blind date process, and the sudden appearance of Jiujiu shocked him. In fact, Xiaoyu has a crush on a netizen named Mi Xue. Due to his own personality, he has always maintained a close relationship with him, and has been unable to take a crucial step.
