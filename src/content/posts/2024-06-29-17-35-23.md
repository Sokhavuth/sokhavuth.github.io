When the "May 12" earthquake occurred, Beichuan County, Mianyang City was hit particularly hard. In the days of reconstruction after the earthquake, many people in Beichuan lost their relatives in the earthquake, and what Lan Hui lost was his dearest mother. However, the post-earthquake reconstruction work is imminent, and Lan Hui can only hide his mother's nostalgia deep in his heart, and devote himself to work. The county magistrate on wheels ran more than 6,000 kilometers a month, but eventually died on the road. On the day of mourning, the people of Beichuan County spontaneously took to the streets to see Lan Hui on his last journey.
