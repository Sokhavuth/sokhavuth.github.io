The story happened at Northwestern University. Dai Jinglin’s son Dai Xiu (played by Du Haitao) went to Australia, and the father-son relationship broke down; his student Wang Peng (played by Zhang He) ignored the persuasion and plagiarized his teacher’s scientific research results in order to go abroad; his wife Shen Yufen (played by Xi Meijuan) ) is dissatisfied with him because he focuses on scientific research and neglects his family; his closed disciple Mao Xi (played by Wang Lixin) thinks that he only knows how to read but not patriotic, so he no longer calls him a teacher. Following Dai Xiu's death, Dai Jinglin suddenly discovered his son's secret. Mao Xi saw another side of Dai Jinglin's speech abroad; Wang Peng and Shen Yufen also accidentally learned of Dai Jinglin's good intentions. However, at this moment, Dai Jinglin fell down.
