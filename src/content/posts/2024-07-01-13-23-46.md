During the Northern Song Dynasty, Qin Xianglian's husband Chen Shimei went to Beijing to rush for the exam, but there was no news for three years. After the death of her parents-in-law, Qin Xianglian took a pair of children, Brother Dong and Sister Chun, to Bianliang, Tokyo to find her husband. Unexpectedly, Chen Shimei had already won the top prize in high school and was recruited as a concubine. Not only did Chen not recognize Qin Xianglian's mother and son, but instead sent his family general Han Qi to prepare to kill him secretly. After learning the truth of the incident, Han Qi let Xianglian's mother and son go, and committed suicide in outrage.
With the help of Xiang Wang Yanling, Qin Xianglian went to Kaifeng Mansion to appeal to Bao Gong. Bao Gong designed to lure Chen Shimei to the Kaifeng government office, and persuaded Chen Shimei to recognize Xianglian's mother and son. Chen Shimei not only refused to listen to the advice, but acted arrogantly. Guotai and Huanggu heard the news and came to intercede one after another. Bao Gong was stern and selfless, and refused one by one, and finally Chen Shimei was executed.
