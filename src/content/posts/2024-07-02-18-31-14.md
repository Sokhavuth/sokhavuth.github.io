Chibi is the son of Mo Xie, a famous swordsmith in the Spring and Autumn Period. Because his father was killed by the cruel King of Chu, he was determined to avenge his father out of filial piety. But the king of Chu learned in advance that he was arrested everywhere, and it was difficult for him to move. Later, with the help of knights, he fulfilled his long-cherished wish.
