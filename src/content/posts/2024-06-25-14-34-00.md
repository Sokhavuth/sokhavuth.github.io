The film tells the story of Caiyun, a small famous actor of the county troupe, who goes to Shanghai to find the "star dream". After seeking refuge in Shanghai with her childhood sweetheart, Ah Wei, who was a photography assistant, Caiyun suddenly realized that Big Shanghai is indeed an ever-changing world, and even Ah Wei could only live in a house that was about to be demolished. The dream became out of reach, but under the influence of the idealistic director Pan, Ah Wei filmed documentaries of veteran filmmakers Zhao Dan and Huang Zongying. Zhao Dan and Huang Zongying's love for movies and the love they developed while making movies all correspond to the life and love between Caiyun and Ah Wei.
