A female skeleton was found in Hanoi near the shanty town of Xujiahui, Shanghai. Inspector Zhong Lang (played by Lu Liangwei) of the patrol house, scientist Kang Huasheng (played by Xu Liang), and female professor Yu Shengnan (played by Li Ruosi) of St. John's University went to the scene together. After investigation, it was found that the bone had been faked into a dead body that had been dead for three years through a special method. Watson restored it through the skull, and one of the portraits was very similar to Du Lan, the female manager of Shanghai Hujiang Hotel who disappeared mysteriously not long ago. Behind Duran is the gang leader Shun Ye, whose real identity is confusing. Zhong Lang vaguely felt that Dulan was very similar to the work he was doing back then. The people and levels involved in the case became wider and wider, and the top police officers suddenly issued an order to terminate the investigation.
