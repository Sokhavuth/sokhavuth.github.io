"The Photographer" selects a family of photographers in Shenzhen, the marriage, love and career legends of three generations, and brings us back to the tragic years when Guangdong escaped to Hong Kong for the first time in the last century, and for the first time revisited the demobilization construction of tens of thousands of engineers and soldiers.
