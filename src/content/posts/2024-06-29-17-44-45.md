The Japanese army invaded China, killed our compatriots, seized our land, and ran amok and did whatever they wanted on Chinese land. Since ancient times, heroes have been born in youth. During the Anti-Japanese War, a group of young heroes emerged in the Chinese nation. At the moment of national peril, they, together with their parents, shouldered the heavy struggle with their immature shoulders.

Several passionate youths headed by Huang Ce used their own methods to secretly destroy Japanese military facilities. By chance, they joined the radio station opened by Luo Mingyi. The Japanese chamber of commerce in Beiping was nominally a businessman, but it was actually supplying supplies for the Japanese invaders. After the team members learned the news, after careful consideration and close arrangements, they used the radio station as a cover to retaliate against the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and resolutely annihilated them with the spirit of not being afraid of sacrifice. In the end, they made indelible contributions to the War of Resistance Against Japan in their own way.
