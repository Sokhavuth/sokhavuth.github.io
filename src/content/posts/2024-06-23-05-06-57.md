In the 1980s, a pair of Han cadres who supported the frontiers both died in Tibet, leaving behind an orphan named Zeng Danqing. In gratitude, a local lama living in the monastery worked hard to raise this child, educate him, and guide him to grow up. Zeng Danqing lived up to the expectations and integrated Tibetan murals with traditional Chinese paintings and oil paintings, gradually forming his own painting style and becoming a world-class outstanding painter. And he gave up all preferential treatment and resolutely returned to the lama, composed a new movement of Tibetan and Han national unity, flesh and blood, life and death.
