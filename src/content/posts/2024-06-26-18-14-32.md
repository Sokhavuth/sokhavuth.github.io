At the end of April 1932, the Japanese invaders held the Songhu War Victory Ceremony in Shanghai Hongkou Park. Unexpectedly, the bombing planned by the provisional police chief of the Republic of Korea, Kim Koo, resulted in the death of the commander of the Japanese army dispatched to Shanghai on the spot. After that, Jin Jiu publicly claimed to be responsible for the incident, and the Japanese side became furious and offered a reward of 600,000 yuan for the capture of Jin Jiu. Chu Fucheng , a celebrity in Jiaxing who holds an important position in the Zhejiang government, admired Jin Jiu's courage, so he took huge risks to provide him with protection. The national situation is in turmoil, and bandits flee everywhere. Hou Jingzong, the puppet county magistrate of Jiaxing who was greedy for profit, hated Chu Fucheng, colluded with the Japanese invaders, and secretly sent spies to Chu's house to investigate Jin Jiu's whereabouts.
In troubled times, legends about integrity and faith were staged.
