In the wave of the industrial revolution, engines have always been an important core in promoting the rapid progress of industry. After more than a century of continuous progress and innovation, engine technology has reached incredible heights. Whether it is the powerful power sources on the aircraft carrier or the huge engines that push the space rockets out of the earth's gravity, these are already very impressive.
<br/><br/>
However, what we are going to introduce today is not an ordinary engine, but an epoch-making industrial miracle - the world's largest ship dual-fuel engine. This giant engine was independently developed and manufactured by more than 120 scientists in China. Its size is comparable to a five-story building, its weight reaches an astonishing 2,100 tons, and its power reaches 64,000 kilowatt hours. A modification machine of this size is unique in the world.
