Back then, Yang Decai, who was short and unattractive, was just a migrant worker in the city, but with his hard work, he eventually became the boss of a real estate company with a net worth of over 100 million. However, maybe he is too focused on his career, or maybe his appearance is really not outstanding, Yang Decai has been a loner and a bachelor all these years. Undoubtedly, the old mother in the country was worried that he had always lied to her that he was already married. One day, the old lady insisted on going to the city to meet her daughter-in-law, which made Yang Decai very anxious.

As the saying goes, he went to the doctor in a hurry, so Yang Decai found a marriage agency in desperation. The boss, Wang Cheng'en, saw that Qian was open-minded, and immediately ordered his favorite general, Liu Yingxiu, to handle the matter in person. Yang Decai, who concealed his identity, actually made a lot of jokes during the blind date.
