In 1958, Dr. Deng Jiaxian, who had returned from studying in the United States, accepted the task of secretly developing an atomic bomb and kept his anonymity ever since. After hard work, it provided a theoretical design for the birth of China's first atomic bomb. In 1964, China successfully exploded its first atomic bomb, and Deng Jiaxian contributed a lot.
