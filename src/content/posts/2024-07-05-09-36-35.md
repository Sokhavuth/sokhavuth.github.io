The self-esteemed reporter Yu Meiren is a hot promotion candidate on the TV station. In order to defeat her opponent, she does not hesitate to challenge the interview task that no one can do-go to a remote town in the south to reveal the important secrets of an organic farm. Unexpectedly, Yu Meiren not only met the "pig teammate" there - the off-line boy Xiao Da and the second-year girl Momo, but also found that the low-key and casual farmer was his "nemesis" - Li Shiquan, a primary school classmate. When she was a child, as long as the two were within 50 meters of each other, she would be unlucky. However, for the sake of the cause, Yu Meiren had to wipe out the sparks between the enemy and the friend with the "Ke Xing". While maintaining a distance of 50 meters, a piece of erratic, hilarious and touching love is quietly blooming in this romantic town.
