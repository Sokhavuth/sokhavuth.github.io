Doctor Wei Guo (played by Xu Ye) has had many happy events recently. His foreign wife, Emma (played by Maria), invested in the establishment of a technology and trade company. Double happiness. The problem is that the mother (played by Li Jing) in the northeastern countryside will be the one who will serve the confinement. The mother-in-law was spoiled by the addition of Dingxi at home, but the daughter-in-law did not catch a cold with her pig’s trotter soup and crucian carp soup. She didn’t drink anything except coke, and the daughter-in-law would throw away anything the mother-in-law boiled. The fire at the city gate brought disaster to Chiyu, and the hired nanny Lanlan was fired. The reason was that her mother-in-law was reluctant to pay 1,000 yuan per month for nanny. Lan Lan left, and new problems followed. Emma asked the baby to use diapers, while the mother-in-law insisted on using traditional diapers made by herself. Facing the dispute between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, Wei Guo had to stand up.
