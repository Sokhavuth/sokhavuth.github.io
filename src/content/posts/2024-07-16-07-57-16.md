Luoyang is one of the oldest imperial capital cities in China with many impressive culture heritages which are dated back to the Song Dynasty.
<br/><br/>
Luoyang is situated along the northern side of the Luo River. The train station is located to the north of the town centre, and Jinguyuan Lu goes from the station to Wangcheng Square. 
<br/><br/>
Tourists come here primarily to see the Longmen Caves, The White Horse Temple and Guanlin Temple which all lie in proximity to the town, rather than the town itself.
