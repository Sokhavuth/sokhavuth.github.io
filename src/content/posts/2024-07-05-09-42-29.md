This story is about the clear and beautiful world in the eyes of children, about the impact of everything that adults have on a simple child's world and outlook on life, and about the mental journey of an ignorant teenager's inner growth... Money, ambiguity, desire, deceit, all these Adults seem so normal that there is nothing wrong with it, but these are swallowing up children's cognition and views on the beautiful world.
