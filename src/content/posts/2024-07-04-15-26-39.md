The story happened in the 1930s. In the face of the Japanese invaders, the sons and daughters of Yanzhao rose up to resist without fear of violence, and wrote an impassioned anti-Japanese song with their flesh and blood and the soul of the nation. The peaceful life of a small village in the north was broken by the invading Japanese army. The Japanese army stationed nearby often went out in groups to plunder food and humiliate the people. One evening in winter, Dachun (played by Zhang Yu) went to the well to fetch water, and met Goudan (played by Hu Shiqun) who had returned from herding. Be on your guard.
