In 1922, Hajab was born in the Xilin Gol home. He has been very good at singing since he was a child, and has a good reputation on the prairie. When the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was established, Hajab became a soloist in the song and dance troupe, and was hailed as the singer of the people by Chairman Mao. His wife Idchin persuaded him to go back to the pastoral area to sing, but he insisted on refusing. During the Cultural Revolution, Hajab was wrongly imprisoned. Ten years later, Hajab was released. And Idchin has passed away. In the recording studio, Hajab could not sing the Urtiin duu that climbed up and lingered down no matter what. Amidst the sadness, an impromptu Urtiin duu "Old Wild Goose" became his swan song in this life. In 2005, Hajab passed away quietly in his hometown. In 2008, the United Nations listed the Urtiin duu as a world oral intangible cultural heritage protection project.
