Gou Sheng (played by Wang Dazhi), who has returned from learning martial arts in Shaolin Temple, has a crush on his childhood sweetheart Xinger (played by Ge Xiaofeng), but he was rejected by his father-in-law (played by Luo Jingmin) as a poor second generation. Gou Sheng, who has no family property inheritance, and no skills to start a business, can only join the army instead of his brother, earning military salary by sacrificing his life, and saving money to propose a marriage. However, in the process of joining the army, he was not only framed by his rival in the same village, Yang San (played by Guo Jinjie), but also encountered many bizarre twists and turns.
