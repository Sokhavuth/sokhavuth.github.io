This is the worldâ€™s largest 5G port built with an investment of US$18 billion from China. Here, the annual container handling volume reaches an astonishing 40 million TEUs, equivalent to the annual handling volume of all ports in the United States combined. More than 720 million tons of cargo are shipped from this port every year and are ultimately shipped to more than 200 countries in the world.
<br/><br/>
Even though this is one of the busiest ports in the world, you'll hardly see many people here. Because there are only 120 employees in the entire port, their main task is to use technology to control hundreds of automated "robots" in the port area from an office area 100 kilometers away, and to move and stack containers quickly and accurately. For the past 14 years, the port has maintained its leading position in global container throughput.

So you are as curious as me, how do 120 staff manage the world's largest port?
