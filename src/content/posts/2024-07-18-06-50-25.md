Loser's father in the eyes of a daughter, a mysterious "dumb" caddie, four spare tire players with "unpredictable" each, a club heir who forced a smile, and a second-hand agent in charge. Five people who seem to have failed in life gathered together in the once brilliant "Miracle Badminton Club" which is now on the verge of bankruptcy. What they have to face is the only sponsor who is about to withdraw funds and the aggressive creditor underworld big brother. They can only have one chance to turn around and participate in the last feather game that decides success or failure, but the time left for them is not Running out. Moreover, behind this seemingly peaceful event, there is actually a turbulent undercurrent. Can the "miracle" be staged again? There is only life and death in the arena!
