The movie "Feng Menglong's Legend" is the first time to put Feng Menglong's life story on the big screen. It tells about Feng Menglong's legendary experience from Suzhou to Shouning, and his political career because of his writing. The main performance content is his experience as an official in Shouning. Deeds such as fighting against Japanese pirates, eradicating tigers, banning baby girls, advocating culture and education, etc., show his image of caring for the people, pragmatism and integrity. On the occasion of the 96th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, the film uses Feng Menglong's rich cultural creation, noble life ethics, diligent and honest governance philosophy, steadfast patriotism and pragmatic love for the people as a birthday gift to the party.
