The story takes place in the period of the Republic of China. Aixiu (played by He Lin) married a farmer, Axiang, and gave birth to a son for him. Suffering from an incurable disease and lingering on the bed, it brought a heavy blow to the family. In desperation, Ah Xiang "pawned" his wife Aixiu to the wealthy Li family for three years. The wife of the Li family was barren.

Amidst the humiliation and pain, Aixiu became pregnant with the offspring of the Li family, but after she gave birth to the child, her situation in the Li family plummeted. Aixiu and Axiang met secretly, and was found out by Master Li. Master Li understood that Aixiu was attached to her husband and children, so he canceled the original agreement. In this way, Aixiu changed from a reproductive tool to a servant in Li's house.
