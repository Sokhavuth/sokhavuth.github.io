"New Red River Valley" takes the beautiful and moving love story as the main line, tells a story of a minority ethnic group helping each other and fighting against the enemy together. It reveals the fate of small people in the turbulent era of history and the unique national complex of Chinese migration, revealing the profound cultural heritage and the true meaning of the continuous blood of the Chinese nation. The time and space of the film runs through the past and the present, especially showing the bloody struggle of people of different identities and classes such as Han, Yi, and Hani under the bullying of foreign powers a hundred years ago to protect their homes, protect tin mines, build inch-gauge railways and even sacrifice their lives The story of the Anti-Japanese War is deeply touching and has a strong educational significance of patriotism.
