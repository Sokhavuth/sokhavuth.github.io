The film uses flashbacks to reveal many little-known stories about Wang Jinxi by telling what the American female reporter Lucy saw and heard in Daqing, and to reproduce and restore to the world a real image of an iron man with strong bones and a soft heart. Observe the history with your eyes, read and feel the Iron Man. The film vividly portrays the strong sense of responsibility and mission of a generation of PetroChina people represented by the iron man Wang Jinxi to the motherland, the people, the cause, and the family.
