As a film reflecting modern rural life, "Tong Xi" tells the story of Jia Quan, a good old man in the village, who earns a living by running orchards and restaurants, but due to the village's custom of following etiquette, he cannot make ends meet. As a result, a series of ironic stories about family, money, etc. were triggered. It is a rural comedy movie with the theme of changing customs.
