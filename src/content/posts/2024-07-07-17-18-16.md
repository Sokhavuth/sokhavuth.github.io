The young Yue Fei lives in Yuejiazhuang with a few friends. During the Northern Song Dynasty, Yuejiazhuang opened a school, and the teacher of the school was the famous Zhou Dong. Zhou Tong liked Yue Fei very much, accepted Yue Fei as his apprentice, and taught him martial arts. Other children also wanted to practice martial arts, and Zhou Tong's granddaughter, Zhou Yao, became their "instructor". Pan Jun, the son of the magistrate of Tangyin, also entered the school, and was an enemy of Yue Fei everywhere. Zhou Tong's former apprentice Shi Wengong escaped from Liangshan's death, sneaked into Tangyin, and accidentally accepted Pan Jun as his apprentice. Shi Wengong kidnapped Zhou Yao and forced Zhou Tong to hand over all martial arts books. After Zhou Tong was injured, Yue Fei led Niu Gao and other buddies to make arrangements, and beat Shi Wengong and a few of his subordinates to s**t.
