The Xulong Hydropower Station in China, projected to cost 250 billion, has successfully closed its flow during construction. This power station, situated on the Jinsha River, will bring electricity to millions of households and signifies a major energy achievement. Once completed, it's estimated to generate roughly 10.5 billion kilowatt-hours annually, equivalent to saving 3.15 million tons of standard coal and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 7.86 million tons. The station, built by Yangtze River Design Group, started in May 2004. An array of challenges faced due to its complex location was overcome through careful planning and tireless work of engineers. Ecological measures were taken to minimize environmental impact, completing a significant step in sustainable development. The Xulong Hydropower Station marks a profound impact on energy transformation and nature's protection.
