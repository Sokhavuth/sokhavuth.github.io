The film mainly tells about Ruianbao - the last "utopia" in the rivers and lakes. Those who have fled here will not be hunted down by their enemies. This play tells a series of love-hate stories that happened when the swordsman Ye Piao came to the castle to avenge his master. In the end, Ye Piao discovered the story of the huge treasure conspiracy hidden behind Ryan Fort while cleaning up the traitors of the teacher.
