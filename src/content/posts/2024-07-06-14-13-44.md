Lao Ding, who lives alone, likes to join in the fun, but no one can understand his inner loneliness; Little Liu Peng suffers from autism due to an accident, and has never spoken again. Fate makes the old and the young meet at both ends of the life journey. Loneliness makes them attract each other, accompany each other, and try to find a little spiritual comfort from each other.
