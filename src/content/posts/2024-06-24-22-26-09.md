Class 1, Grade 3, No. 39 Middle School in Qindao City is a class that makes all the teachers in the school turn pale. A group of fifteen-year-old rebellious children in the class ushered in a new class teacher, Cheng Tao, at the beginning of their new semester. This teacher, who has just stepped into the workplace from the university, always puts on a majestic air of "teacher" for his work performance, and tries his best to suppress the children's desire for freedom and release of nature with heavy schoolwork burden and test scores. However, the pronouns of "post-95s" are not "bear" and "forbearance", but "rebellion" and "struggle". Thus, an unprecedented "teacher-student war" kicked off. They are simple, kind, but passionate; they are youthful, fashionable, but not decadent; they are impulsive and fanatical, but not childish. With their persistence to ideals, the most precious innocence in life, and bright smiling faces of fifteen years old, they wrote the most beautiful chapter of youth.
