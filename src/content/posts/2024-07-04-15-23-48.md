"Miaoshan Flower" is based on the Miao girl Xiong Sanmei among the "Three Brothers and Sisters of the Xiong Family" in the Mashan area of Guizhou before liberation. The regiment and the local forces of the Kuomintang launched an arduous struggle. The compatriots of all ethnic groups spontaneously joined the revolutionary cause against the tyranny of the Kuomintang, and praised the great feat of the Communist Party of China to lead the compatriots of ethnic minorities to stand up for liberation.
