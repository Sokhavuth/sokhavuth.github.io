If you were asked to live in a poor area of Africa for 20 years, how long would you last? This may sound a little crazy, but in fact, in Nigeria, there is a Chinese guy who actually lived there for 20 years. He did not immigrate to live here, but because of work arrangements. For the past 20 years, the young man has worked closely with local farmers to grow so-called super rice.
<br/><br/>
Super rice is a high-yield rice variety that can produce more food with less resources. Through the spread of this technology, he has helped about 800,000 people escape hunger. Now, this Chinese young man's good deeds have not only been widely appreciated by the local people, he has even been honored as the local chief.
<br/><br/>
So, in today’s video, we’re going to tell this Chinese man’s story in more depth. We not only talk about how he became the chief, but also explore the important technologies and changes he has brought to Nigeria in the past 20 years.
