China, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan signed a formal agreement for the "China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Railway" on June 6, 2024. Despite earlier Russia's opposition and political turmoil in Kyrgyzstan and mostly because of advancements in their negotiations in 2023, the project is finally beginning. This railway will gradually improve the connection between China and Central Asia and shorten travel time to Western Asia and Europe by 900 km, saving about a week. This rail project has strategic economic and political implications, considering disputes within Kyrgyzstan over its potential benefits and challenges around railway gauge standards and significant funding.
