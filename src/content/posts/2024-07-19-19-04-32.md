The Qiongzhou Strait bridge connecting mainland China and Hainan Island, a hot topic especially during the 2024 Spring festival due to travel congestion, has remained unbuilt for nearly a hundred years, despite its distance of only 20km. Major issues include complex geological conditions like frequent earthquakes, strong winds, and high waves, and an average strait depth of 44 meters, requiring bridge piers as tall as a 30-storey building. While an undersea tunnel is an option, it presents its own set of challenges including difficult exit ramps, sesimic activity, and high costs. The bridge's absence raises questions not just on the technical and economic aspects, but also touches upon historical and cultural considerations.
