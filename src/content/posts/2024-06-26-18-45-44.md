The time goes back to 1979, when Xu Haifeng (played by Li Dongxue), who was an educated youth who went to the countryside at that time, participated in the 4th Anhui Provincial Games with an amateur air gun and won the championship of the air rifle group. The team did not recruit him. Three years later, Xu Haifeng, who works in the Hexian Supply and Marketing Cooperative, took part in the shooting competition of the Anhui Provincial Games for the second time and won the championship again, but in the end he was not admitted to the provincial team because of his age. What is even more unfortunate is that Xu Haifeng injured his eyes and almost lost his sight in order to defend the country's property at work. Unexpectedly, at this time, coach Wu Quanqing (played by Lin Lin) brought the secondment notice of the provincial team. To go or not to go, Xu Haifeng was caught in a difficult choice.

In the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, Xu Haifeng was in very good condition and ranked first. With the last three shots left in the game, suddenly his old eye disease relapsed and he had to rest. At this time, Xu Haifeng was sitting in the lounge with mixed feelings.
