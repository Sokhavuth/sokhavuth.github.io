The film "Rong Ken" expresses a deep cultural thinking: Under the impact of the market economy, national culture is facing disappearance to varying degrees, and traditional morals are gradually dying out. In this conflict between ancient and modern civilizations, the director uses vivid film and television language to show the audience a story of the return of humanity under the influence of the Pumi priest Shibi. The film objectively reflects the conscious protection and inheritance of the excellent traditional culture of "Rongken" by the Pumi people in the context of globalization.
