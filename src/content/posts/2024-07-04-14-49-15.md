The film tells the story of Tang Xiaoyan, an insurance elite of returnees, who was transferred from Beijing to Neijiang, a small town in Bashu, due to work reasons, and met Duan Xiaoyu who devoted herself to running a nursing home. Of the two of them, one is tricky and mean, the other is honest and dull; love story.
