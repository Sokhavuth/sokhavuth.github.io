The movie "The Woman Watching the Village" was planned by Li Qunjie, a well-known writer from Henan. It is a film that uses Henan dialect to show the most innocent, firm and poignant love stories of ordinary people in contemporary rural areas. During the filming period, the crew went to Xiangcheng village in Henan Province and Chayashan hot spring town in Suiping to shoot. In addition to showing the beautiful scenery of Henan plains and mountain villages, a large number of people including Li Yanqiu, Zhai Xiaoxing, Liu Yue and Fang Xiaoli were also gathered. The addition of well-known actors, especially the famous crosstalk performer Hou Yaohua and sketch performer Gong Hanlin, added a lot of fun and appreciation to the film.
