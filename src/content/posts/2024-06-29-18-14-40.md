The film will reproduce the real scene of the Red Army's forced crossing of the Wujiang River, and use modern technology to miniaturize the real scene of the Long March to intuitively and vividly show the difficulty, tragedy and greatness of the 25,000-mile Long March of the Red Army of Chinese Workers and Peasants. The plot of the film revolves around the natural features of Wujiang River, and the battle scenes between the enemy and ourselves are wonderful and realistic, showing the feat of the Red Army's forced crossing of Wujiang River.
