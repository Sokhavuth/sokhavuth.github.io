On June 18 this year, the Russian President made a state visit to North Korea, during which the two sides signed the Treaty on Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, deepening the relationship between the two countries.

But what is more worthy of our attention is that Russia and North Korea have reached a consensus on the "Tumen River" issue. Before this, Russia discussed this matter with China, and while developing the "Far East Strategy", it can also add a new outlet to China's north.

Now, the three parties have officially recognized this strategic project. However, this decision has caused concern in Japan, who believe that this strategic plan is a huge threat.

So why does Japan oppose this strategic project? How important is the development of the "Tumen River" to China?
