In the early summer of 1949, Mao Zedong decided to visit the Soviet Union and sent a number of national gifts for Stalin's 70th birthday, among which Hunan embroidery was designated as one of the gifts. Lao Zhou, the special commissioner of our party, secretly sneaked into the city of Changsha, which is yet to be liberated, with a radio station and a copy of "Needle Book", and set up a secret radio station in Furong Embroidery Village. The direct contact promoted the peaceful uprising in Hunan. At this time, Yi Pingchuan, a special commissioner of the Kuomintang's military reunification, also entered Changsha to monitor and suppress the upper-level Kuomintang officials and progressives. Lao Zhou's whereabouts have been grasped by Yi Pingchuan from the very beginning and he has laid a net of heaven and earth, and the city of Changsha is overcast.
