"Children Studying 2" tells the story of Kaikai who was forced to be separated from the stray dog "Xiaorener" when he went to school in the city. Thin telephone wires are connected. In order to let Xiao Rener eat, Kai Kai quietly picked up scraps to make up for the phone bill to make long-distance calls to Xiao Rener. After the Spring Festival, Kaikai and the new friends he met in the city finally welcomed the courage to visit relatives in the city. Xiao Daner learned to pick up waste, but unfortunately got into a car accident. Kaikai read the book to the dying Xiaoren with tears... The film focuses on the children of migrant workers, a vulnerable group, and portrays their living and spiritual conditions with a strong sense of social responsibility.
