In 1927, the Kuomintang reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek betrayed Mr. Sun Yat-sen's three major policies of "uniting with Russia, uniting with the Communist Party, and supporting farmers and workers", and under the background of wantonly hunting down and massacring the Communists, the central government started to restore Communist Party's party organizations in the southern provinces. Comrade Zhang Wenbin, who was then Secretary-General of the Central Committee, was appointed to Guangdong to recruit party members, resume the establishment of party organizations at all levels, and establish workers' and peasants' armed forces to actively carry out the anti-Japanese struggle.
