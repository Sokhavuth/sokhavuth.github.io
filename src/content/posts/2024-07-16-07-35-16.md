In the late Ming Dynasty, Liu Qizhong, the emissary of Jinyiwei Township, was exterminated by his family because he was unwilling to become a minister to the East Factory. Twenty years later, the two surviving descendants of the Liu family took the aliases of Yin Qian and Yin Mo. In order to find the enemy "Golden Rakshasa", the two brothers joined Jinyiwei successively.
