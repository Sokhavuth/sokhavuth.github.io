Song Xiaoxue, whose family is not well off, was elected as the director of the village committee of Yangtoushan Village. Facing this big village with few resources, the young girl had many difficulties. At this time, his lover Zhiyuan, who had lost contact with him for more than a year, came back from the big city, and stayed in the village to work in the primary school, seeming to have a secret that he couldn't know. With his help, Xiaoxue found a way to develop the folk culture village, giving new hope to this ancient village full of cultural resources. Xiaoxue's responsibilities to her family and her hometown made her more determined, but the unpredictable and worrying love made her feel sweet and hard. In the blend of bitterness and joy, Xiaoxue welcomed the first batch of guests of the Folk Village. On her birthday——Xiaoxue (solar terms) day, she also welcomed the long-awaited Xue. In this winter, the protagonist has a deep sadness, but she doesn't feel cold—because she made a decision that ordinary people can't understand but she firmly believes in.
