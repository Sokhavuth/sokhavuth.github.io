The film takes Huaqiangbei, the base of technological innovation, as the background, and shows the difficulties and growth of five young people in the process of starting a business. The story originated when business tycoon Lin Youcheng invested 5 million yuan to recruit a maker team to create a "childhood playmate" for his son - an intelligent companion robot. Yu Kuai, a know-how expert in Huaqiangbei Electronic Components, Jiang Chao, a tech geek, and Christina, an elite female sea turtle, formed a maker team to develop robots. In the process of developing the robot, several people racked their brains and finally independently developed the serial steering gear to overcome technical difficulties, but was sued by a foreign company for patent infringement. Lin Youcheng also took the opportunity to ask them to stop the development.
