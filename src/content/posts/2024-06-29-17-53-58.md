On the eve of the founding ceremony in 1949, Tian Zhenying (Pan Yueming), captain of the dance team of the Anti-Enemy Drama Club of the Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Military Region, received an order from her superiors to decorate the Tiananmen Gate for the founding ceremony. The dilapidated old city buildings, the stinking Jinshui River, and the weed-covered square must all be replaced by October 1st. At this time, there were only 28 days left before the National Ceremony, and the scene near Tiananmen was in full swing. Countless revolutionary soldiers and civilians were working day and night for the Ceremony. But the decoration encountered difficulties at the beginning, and the red cloth for decorating the tower was seriously out of stock. The task is still arduous, and the time is getting closer. In order to carry out the founding ceremony smoothly, and to complete the task to meet Chairman Mao, the choreographer team overcame all difficulties and finally successfully completed the task of arranging the Tiananmen Gate.
