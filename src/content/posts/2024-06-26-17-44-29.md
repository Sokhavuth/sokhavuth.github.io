In remote mountain villages that cannot afford to marry a guest, in order to continue the incense and pass on the family line, the men here have "borrowed their mothers to have children" from outside the mountains for thousands of years. . When Wan'er was 18 years old, because of her husband's tuberculosis, she was sent from outside the mountains to give birth to the Lu family on behalf of Lu's family, but it was only when she entered the Lu's house that she realized that two brothers had raped her at the same time. During the contact with the two brothers, Wan'er developed a good impression of Lu Da, and tried every means to avoid Lu Er, and wanted to make things happen with Lu Da, so she could have a son and get money back home as soon as possible. For this reason, the two brothers turned against each other. Lu Dawei eased the relationship between the brothers and planned to leave home. He said that we never knew who our mother was since we were young, and we can no longer let our children lose their mothers. One day we will all be able to marry a wife in a dignified manner. That year, when the Red Army came to the mountains, everything changed.
