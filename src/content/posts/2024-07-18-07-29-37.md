A bus was driving on the rugged mountain road in Beichuan. People were drowsy at noon. Song Geng, who was rushing back to celebrate his daughter's birthday, was eager to return home. When he was talking with his daughter on the phone, the land suddenly fell apart. The road was flat just now In an instant, it turned into a cliff, the bus hovered on the cliff, Song Geng jumped off the car and fled, there was no voice on the phone, and the bus behind him fell into the cliff. A rare earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 on the Richter scale hit Beichuan and other places in ruins.
