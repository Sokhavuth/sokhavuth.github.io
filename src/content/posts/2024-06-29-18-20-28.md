During the Husong War in 1932, the Japanese invaders held a military parade in the name of celebrating the Tianchang Festival to threaten the Chinese side to make concessions in the negotiations. The Chinese underground organized a "lore team" to sabotage secretly. When the Japanese learned that the "lore team" was wiped out, a lunch box explosive was detonated during the military parade, turning the festival into a festival of death.
