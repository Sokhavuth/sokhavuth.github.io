At the end of the Qing Dynasty, Ji Jianqing, the head-captor, secretly ganged up on Huo Shaoyun to save his seriously ill son, and was sentenced to exile. Ten years later, Ji Jianqing, who returned to his hometown, discovered that his son had stolen the ancient Buddha in the village. In order to pay off his son's debt, he embarked on the road to find his son, but encountered his enemy Huo Shaoyun again. In the end Ji Jianqing fulfilled his promise, and justice also defeated evil.
