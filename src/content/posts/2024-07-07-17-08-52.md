The story takes place in the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. On this day, the national player Shi Xiangxia (played by Zhang He) dared to play against Qianlong (played by Fu Cong), and the result was a tie. Wei Zhangbang looks for Fan Xiping. At this time, Fan Xiping was thrown into prison for offending the county magistrate Wu, and an adult surnamed Wu under Li Wei was also thrown into prison for causing trouble after drinking, and became Fan Xiping's "neighbor". Li Wei immediately sent someone to send Fan Xiping to Beijing. The brothers and sisters meet in the capital and discuss how to play chess with the emperor. The result is that they would rather offend the prince and ministers than the emperor. On this day, Qianlong ordered Fan Xiping to enter the palace to play chess, and the princes and ministers were in court to judge.
