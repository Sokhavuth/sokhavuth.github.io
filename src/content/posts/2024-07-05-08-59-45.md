Wawa is a 7-year-old Lisu child. He is very envious of his elder sister Naxiang who can skate across the river with her friends to study every day. The mother insisted that the doll can not be zipped until the father came back with him. But the father who works outside never returns.
<br/><br/>
Finally, unable to resist the temptation from the other side, Wawa sneaked across the river alone, and saw the school she had wanted for a long time! Unexpectedly, the secret of Wawa zipping across the river was punctured by Teacher Nie, who came to visit her home for the first time! It was the pair of red rain boots sent by Teacher Nie that kept Wawa at home.
<br/><br/>
He promised his mother and sister: With this pair of shoes, he will no longer sneak around.
Early the next morning, the sensible Wawa returned the pair of beautiful rain boots to her sister.
The days passed peacefully like this. No one would have imagined that, because she was in a rush to bring back a pair of new shoes for her younger brother, her elder sister, Naxiang, slipped off the zipline and fell into the river...
