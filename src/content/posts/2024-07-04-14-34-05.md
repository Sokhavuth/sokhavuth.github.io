Army was ordered by the Central Military Commission to cross the Yellow River to fight westward. This is the famous West Route Army. Enemy soldiers frantically besieged along the way for days on end, the vast Gobi desert was freezing cold. In January 1937, the Fifth Army, Ninth Army and Thirty Army of the West Route Army went through hardships and captured Gaotai, Linze and other strongholds. The arrival of this important victory also means that the final bloody battle of life and death has begun. At that time, Ma Bufang, the commander of the second district of the Kuomintang and the chairman of Qinghai Province, was a cunning and vicious overlord with one hand covering the sky. He sent surprise soldiers to separate and surround Linze and other places. After eight days and nights of fighting, the high platform where the Red Army was located fell, and Ma Bufang immediately launched a crazy siege and bloody massacre against the Red Army.
