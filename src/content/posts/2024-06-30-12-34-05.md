This caused strong dissatisfaction among the people represented by An Dengbang. For the benefit of the local people, An Dengbang took the lead in resisting donations and taxes, and even led the crowd to rob the execution ground. On his way out of Beichuan to "escape from trouble", An Dengbang was injured in a fierce battle with the pursuing Sichuan army. He happened to encounter the Red Army at a critical moment...
