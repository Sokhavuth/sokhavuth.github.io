Go player Jiliu first came to Tokyo to study abroad, and fell into a dilemma in life. On the train to Chiba, he had a strange encounter with Igarashi, who was carrying vegetables to Beijing. From then on, his life entered a strange stage. In the circle, he and Igarashi's grandson Shoichi, Shoichi's girlfriend Nanako, and the hotel waiter Kami Naito began to have a relationship that is constantly cutting and messing up. The restless youth, the girl in a foreign country, and the unwavering dream of Go, blended with fire and ice in the depressed and passionate years.
