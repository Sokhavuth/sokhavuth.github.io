This film is adapted from a true story. In the autumn of 2001, a pair of outdoor travelers found two old people in the remote mountains and old forests. They were Shishan and Honggu who disappeared from the village more than 40 years ago. Today, they seem to be living in a primitive society of slash-and-burn farming, living in self-made earthen houses, lighting self-made oil lamps, eating self-grown food, drinking mountain spring water, and everything is self-sufficient. For decades, they have given birth to children and gained steadfastness. Nearly half a century has passed, and Shi Shan has chiselled more than 6,000 stone steps on the mountain with his own hands, in order not to let his own woman go out to wrestle, and he himself has grown from a gray-haired old man to a white-haired old man. The 6,000-level stone steps are called "the ladder of love", and the ancient love is thought-provoking.
