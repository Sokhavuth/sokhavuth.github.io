For Song Yao, the seven days spent with her husband in the old house of her mother-in-law's house in the countryside can be described as unforgettable and painstaking. It was seven nights that could not be looked back on and the fear from the bottom of her heart.
<br/><br/>
Song Yao, who came to the countryside with her husband for honeymoon, thought she could spend it leisurely, but when she walked into this old house, Song Yao felt something was wrong. The old house exudes a strange smell, it seems that there are eyes hidden in the corner, staring at you silently; the maid in the old house also looks dull, with disheveled hair, looking abnormal; People are frightened; and the Buddhist hall in the house seems to hide a mystery. Feeling strange, Song Yao began to feel scared because her husband left for something, especially when night fell. The darkness gives space for unclean things to grow, and all the secrets buried deep in the old house are ready to be revealed, the red doll in the bathtub, the female voice crying in the middle of the night... Through Song Yao's Seven Nights, we can see the truth of the matter, and The most terrifying thing is the human heart.
