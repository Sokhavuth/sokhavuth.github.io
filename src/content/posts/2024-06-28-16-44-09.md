Lao Yangtou  is an old entertainer living alone in Huaxian County, Shaanxi Province. His family has a complete set of business for performing shadow puppetry. One day, the son who had been away from home for many years suddenly brought back his foreign girlfriend and grandson Brooks. Lao Yang, whose ideas were shocked, hadn't recovered yet, and his son and girlfriend hurriedly gave Brookstower to themselves because they were going to work in Hoh Xil. Unprepared, Lao Yang had to act jerky as the caretaker of his foreign grandson. The grandson and grandson often clashed because of cultural differences between the East and the West and language barriers.

In order for Brooks to drink fresh milk, Lao Yang went to the head of the rural cultural station Wang who raised cows. Stationmaster Wang, who is planning to open a class to inherit shadow puppetry, took the opportunity to invite Lao Yangtou to come back. Under the relentless lobbying of Station Master Wang and the influence of Brooks, Lao Yangtou's shadow puppetry class was finally successfully opened, and he and Brooks became intimate because of the unique and warm communication method of shadow puppetry.
