There is such a folk legend that if you hear someone calling your name while walking at night, you must agree after three times, otherwise you will be on the road of no return and will never be able to return to the world. In the village, villagers disappeared one after another, causing panic. Everyone thought it was ghosts. Cai Kang's father lived in this village. One day, he disappeared inexplicably, and Cai Kang's younger sister seemed to be frightened and delirious. Cai Kang was so anxious that he decided to go back to his hometown to find out.
<br/><br/>
For her son's decision, Cai Kang's mother uncharacteristically showed opposition. She only hoped that Cai Kang and his fianc√©e Liu Dan could get married as soon as possible, and live a smooth life without any further twists and turns. Will Cai Kang, who did not listen to his mother, regret his original decision?
