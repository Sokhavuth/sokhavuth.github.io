My parents went to work in the city, and my grandfather took care of nine-year-old Kaikai going to school and living at home.
<br/><br/>
Kai Kai picked up a stray dog and named it Xiaorener. Xiaodan is very timid and dare not bark at ordinary times. Grandpa thinks it is a dumb dog. Xiaodan'er is very smart, he can do whatever he wants, and he will follow him when he takes a step away, for fear of getting lost again. Xiao Daner became Kai Kai's best friend.
