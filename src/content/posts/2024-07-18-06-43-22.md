Today's peaceful and prosperous life is closely related to the sacrifices of countless ancestors. When we are singing and dancing, how can we forget the names of those sleeping in the barren hills of history? Actress Xia Shan (played by Xu Qing) was driving a luxury sports car on a winding mountain road. During this period, she was in a trance for some reason and had a serious car accident. In a deep coma, Xia Shan seemed to hear a call from a hundred years ago. In that era, there seemed to be a man she had cared about for a hundred years, and his appearance was gradually becoming clear. The man's name was Lin Juemin (played by Tong Dawei). He used to be dressed in white and ran up the stairs of his house sweating profusely, persuading Chen Yiying (played by Xu Qing), who was waiting for his girlfriend, to marry a man he didn't love. This side drew a red line in the hearts of the two, and they finally became a couple. And in that turbulent and difficult era, Lin and Chen's love finally turned into a blood-clogging "Letter with Wife"!
This film is adapted from Gong Yingtian's drama of the same name.
