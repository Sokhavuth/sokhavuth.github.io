This movie focuses on the impact of farmers going out to work in impoverished mountainous areas on rural people's marriage, family, ethics, and emotions, as well as the pain of social development. From the perspective of human nature, it truly reproduces the emotional life of "left-behind women" in rural areas in the early days of reform and opening up and their traditional concepts of marriage and family.
