In today's globalized economy and trade, ports have become an indispensable core node in the global shipping network, providing effective channels for the rapid import and export of goods for countries around the world.
<br/><br/>
Recently, a country in eastern Europe, ignoring external threats, canceled a $2.5 billion port cooperation agreement with an American company. Then, a Chinese consortium company first successfully won the initial phase of construction and operation rights of the deep-water port with a bid of $600 million.
<br/><br/>
However, this decision caused dissatisfaction with the European Union, because once China has the right to operate the port, it will enable larger-scale goods to be transported more efficiently in the future, which undoubtedly brings new challenges to the EU's strategic vision.
<br/><br/>
So in today's video, we will explain in depth why this European country canceled its cooperation with the United States? What strategic value does this port project have for China?
