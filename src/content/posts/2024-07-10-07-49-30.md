China's construction of the Padma Bridge in Bangladesh, the country's longest bridge, is an example of its extensive infrastructure developments. Opened in June 2022, the bridge's toll revenue exceeded 7.9 billion tals within a year of operation. It faced construction challenges regarding the tropical monsoon climate and riverbed silt. However, it has significantly improved logistics, personnel exchange, and reduced travel time, boosting regional economic growth. The bridge symbolizes the cooperative achievements between China and Bangladesh.
