The Himalayas, this huge natural wonder, spans five Asian countries, including China, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, and India.
<br/><br/>
The mountain range is famous for its breathtaking scenery and extreme geographical features. It is about 2,450 kilometers long and between 200 and 300 kilometers wide. The Himalayas are not only the highest mountains in the world, but also the Mount Everest, which is an astonishing 8,848.86 meters high and the highest point on Earth. Every year, it attracts hordes of mountaineering enthusiasts and explorers to challenge it.
<br/><br/>
But you may not know that in the southeastern region of this mountain range, there is a grand plan in the works: Chinese engineers plan to invest $80 billion to build a giant dam at the highest altitude in the world. When the dam is completed, the annual power generation capacity will be able to meet the needs of 10 million households.
<br/><br/>
However, before Chinese engineers have started to implement this construction plan, India has expressed its opposition and called on the United Nations to stop the project. So why does India have such a strong reaction to this project? What does it mean for China to build such a hydropower station?
