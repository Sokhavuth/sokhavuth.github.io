The film describes the growth experience of a young soldier Arslen, reflecting that although China and the Soviet Union had their enemies, the friendship between the two peoples has never been interrupted. It is the bounden duty of soldiers to be loyal to the motherland and defend the motherland; but soldiers are all human beings, and human nature tells us that when we encounter a common threat, it is imperative to help us with all our strength. The story emphasizes that Alslen's personal feats go beyond any boundaries, thus embodying the eternal brilliance of humanity emanating from the little man; through his deeds, he educates the officials and the people, and at the same time promotes the spirit of patriotism and international humanitarianism. It shows that peace is a beautiful ideal pursued by all mankind, and maintaining peace and avoiding war is the real purpose of strengthening our military strength.
