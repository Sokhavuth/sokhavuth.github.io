After winning a local fighting competition, Kong Lingfeng, a young man from a small town, used the accumulated prize money as travel expenses to slip out of the house and come to the big city to pursue his fighting dream. He asked the former champion Nie Bo to be his coach. Although he was defeated by the boxer, Kong Lingfeng won everyone's respect. Instead, Nie Bo agreed that Kong Lingfeng would stay in his club and practice fighting while working part-time. In the middle of the night, Kong Lingfeng rescued Xiaotong who was being harassed by gangsters. The two got acquainted, and under Xiaotong's introduction, they got a job as a porter in a supermarket. Kong Lingfeng and Xiaotong gradually fell in love, and they trained harder on weekdays. But he didn't expect that what awaited him would be difficult times. Nie Bo disagrees with Xiaotong and Kong Lingfeng continuing their relationship, and persuades Kong Lingfeng to give up this relationship, and the master and apprentice are at war. However, at this time, Xiaotong had a car accident. Kong Lingfeng persevered and broke through the inner cage. In the end, he not only won the gold belt, but also gained his own love, family affection and friendship!
