Ni, a girl from the Miao nationality, has lived in the beautiful and peaceful Miao Village since she was a child. She made a marriage contract with her childhood sweetheart Bao in Youfangchang early on. When Bao went to college, Ni was attracted by Gao Fei, a dance teacher who came to Miao Village to find the mysterious girl Mei, and wanted to follow him to see the bigger world outside. Bao came back to find that everything had changed. Ni broke the engagement with him, and Ni's father decided to respect her ideas. Unable to keep Ni, he chose to let go, and after hearing the news that Gao Fei had returned to the village, he took the initiative to take Ni to find him. But Ni flinched at that moment, she suddenly understood the meaning of Bao to herself. After the turmoil of "destroying the village", Ni finally chose to leave the village, because she knew that Bao and Jin had understood and supported her, waiting for her to find her dream and return.
