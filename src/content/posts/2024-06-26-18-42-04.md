In a folk motorcycle race, the often defeated general Shen Tianming lost the race again. When he returned to the camp dejectedly, Shen Tianming learned of the death of his ex-wife and left him a 7-year-old daughter, Huixin, who has been taken care of by his ex-wife's sister. It turned out that Shen Tianming neglected his wife seven years ago because he was addicted to motorcycle sports. His wife divorced him and gave birth to a child for him after the divorce. Shen Tianming felt that his life was difficult, and he had never met this child, let alone had any feelings for him, so he rejected the request.
