During the Anti-Japanese War, the family of Aunt Tang, a villager in a small town in southern Jiangsu, resolutely gave away her own daughter in order to protect the offspring of female cadres of the New Fourth Army. In the battle with the Japanese army, Aunt Tang's own son Tang Songlin died heroically. Aunt Tang endured the pain of losing her son and cooperated with the New Fourth Army to tenaciously fight against the Japanese invaders, and finally ushered in victory.
