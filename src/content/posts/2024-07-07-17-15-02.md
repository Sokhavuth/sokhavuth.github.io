After graduating from middle school, Er Ying hoped to join the vast revolutionary world and be a person who followed the trend of the times, but her family found her a job to carry water every day in order to prevent her from participating in political movements. The postman Xiao Li who has the same longing as Er Yinghuai is also kept in the city by his parents and also dislikes the monotonous work life. The rising tide of revolution instigates two sympathetic hearts, and the two get closer, a unique first love story of that era.
