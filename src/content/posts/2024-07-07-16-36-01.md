During the Luoyang Flower Festival, three famous martial arts masters died mysteriously, and Li Shaobai went to investigate the case. Later, it was discovered that the "Peony Messenger" and Ji Shande had murdered the disciples of various factions in order to fight for fame. After Li Shaobai and others killed Ji Shande, they found that there were still black hands behind the Yasha organization.
