Although the Dragon Slaying Society was wiped out, the killing intent is still there. After learning about Bao Zheng and Bai Yutang's plan to abolish the Dragon Slaying Society, the emperor didn't buy it and let Bao Zheng return home. At the beginning of a new killing, Bai Yutang escaped from the pursuit by relying on his own martial arts and wit, but was designated as a wanted criminal. After investigation, the mastermind behind the scenes finally appeared. The truth came out, and Officer Bao Zheng was reinstated.
