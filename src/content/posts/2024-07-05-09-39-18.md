Many years after the criminal policeman's father died in the line of duty, Tian Yan, who inherited her father's bloodliness, also became a policeman, but she was a traffic policeman. On the first day of work, she offended barrister Duanmu Changchun who was rushing to appear in court for following the rules, but the latter didn't care about her at the time, which made her proud. After Li Dui, the leader of the detachment, found out what had happened, he criticized her for not doing things properly, because Duanmu Changchun was very difficult to mess with. Sure enough, the detachment received a summons from the court before the flames arose when she was scolded.

Under the "intimidation" of Li Dui and the instructor, in order not to implicate her personal grievances with Duanmu Changchun in the detachment, Tian Yan bit the bullet and went to Duanmu Changchun to ask for reconciliation. However, their road to love is full of twists and turns because of the deliberate obstruction of Ye Qing, who has a crush on Duanmu Changchun.
