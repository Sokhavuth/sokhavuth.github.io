Liu Yu, a young man born in the 1980s, has a father who is a big boss, drives a famous car, and lives in a villa, but he does not feel happy, especially after his father divorced his mother, and his father found someone who is more handsome than him. Meng Yufei, a college student who is one year younger, is married, and Meng Yufei is the one who has been in love with Liu Yu. Because of this incident, the relationship between Liu Yu and his father became more tense. Liu Yu couldn't get the fatherly love he needed at home, so he found a "dad" on the outside. This dad was far less wealthy than his own dad, but he gave him a lot in terms of ideology, career, and emotion. After receiving Liu Yu's great help and warmth, Liu Yu simply moved out of the villa and moved into the father's rental house. Later, under the mediation of this father, Liu Yu reunited with his own father.
