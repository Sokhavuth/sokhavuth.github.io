China's key project in Georgia, the Gudauri Mountain Tunnel has completed. The tunnel was created with a 3,900 tons machine, reaching an excavation depth of 8,860 meters. Georgia's Prime Minister commended China's "infrastructure maniac". The new North-South Corridor road tunnel will resolve the issue of winter traffic interruption. Adopting a Chinese-developed Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM), the project has demonstrated the "China speed", even setting a record for super-large diameter TBM tunnel construction. The Chinese TBM is the largest globally, supportive of harsh conditions.
