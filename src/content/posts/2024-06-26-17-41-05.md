The film is based on a real story. Du Juan, a female college student who was admitted from a remote and impoverished mountain village, was once raped by a motorcycle driver who was infected with AIDS due to drug abuse on the way home. After suffering from AIDS, she was indifferent and discriminated against by the people around her, so she had no choice but to leave the school. After leaving school, the female college student encountered more accidents and setbacks, but she still faced life bravely and helped more AIDS orphans with her strength and love.
