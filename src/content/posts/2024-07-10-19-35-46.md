Chinese companies were forced to withdraw from a â‚¬610 million Bulgarian railway project amid EU investigations over alleged market distortion via subsidies. The project subsequently went to Spain. The situation highlights the complex dynamics between EU, China and other economies. Being a part of China's Belt and Road Initiative, such infrastructure projects often serve strategic purposes beyond mere economic benefits, making them a subject of intense competition and scrutiny. The future of similar Chinese initiatives in EU territories remains uncertain.
