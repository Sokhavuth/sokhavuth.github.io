The Southern Shaolin Temple was destroyed. Zhishan fell into the river while saving people and was washed away by the rapids. He was rescued on a red boat a few days later. Zhishan suffers a brain injury and loses his memory. He encounters the five who are looking for him along the river by mistake. With the help of Su Sanniang from the Red Boat, the villain's plot was exposed and the scattered disciples in Southern Shaolin were prevented from being killed.
