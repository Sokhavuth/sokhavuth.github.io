Revolutionary writer An'e ran away from home at the age of 17 to join the revolution and fell in love with Tian Han. However, the appearance of Liu Zhihua, who had a marriage contract with Tian Han, made An'e very desperate and left Tian Han. A few years later, An'e and Tian Han met by chance. Facing the destruction of their country and family, the two gave up all their scruples and joined hands to fight against Japan.
