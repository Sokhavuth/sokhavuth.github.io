It tells the story of Hou Debang's growth in his hometown of Minhou County, Fujian Province in his youth. In his youth, Hou Debang worked hard and studied, diligent and studious, and had the reputation of "trailer study". Encouraged by his grandfather, he entered the foreign school run by Shisangu and began to come into contact with advanced Western cultural ideas. When he was a teenager, he saw foreigners using "opium" to harm the bodies and minds of compatriots. Together with his partners Liu Wangli, Xiaoshuang, Shisangu, and Yan Daxian, he exposed the evil deeds of foreigners and tried to find a medicine to treat malaria. While witnessing foreigners bullying Chinese people, Hou Debang gradually embarked on the road of saving the country with science and technology. Many people along the way witnessed his growth.
