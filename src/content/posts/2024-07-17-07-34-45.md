After Qin destroyed the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, Chu State took the opportunity to attack other vassal states of Lu State. As a vassal state of Lu State, Zhuanyu Kingdom faced a crisis of life and death, King Zhuanyu made a gesture of surrender to persuade the people to leave, and made a response plan. After the Chu army broke the city, King Zhuan Yu and his wife did not accept the conditions of the sacrifice, and both died while guarding the altar.
