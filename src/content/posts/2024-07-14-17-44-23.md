During the stalemate between Liangshan and Zengtou City, Chao Gai was shot by Shi Wengong and died. At this time, Lu Junyi, who was rescued by Liangshan heroes, wanted to repay his kindness, and proposed to take Shi Wengong as a nomination to join Liangshan. Lu Junyi took Yan Qing to sneak in as an undercover agent, and after many crises, he finally won Zeng Tou Market and captured Shi Wengong alive.
