In June this year, the EU announced that it would impose a punitive tariff of up to 38.1% on Chinese electric vehicles. The policy officially took effect on July 4. According to experts' estimates, China may lose $5 billion for every 10% increase in tariffs in Europe.

But in the face of EU sanctions, China did not sit idly by. Subsequently, Beijing announced that it would launch an anti-dumping investigation on pork and its by-products exported from the EU. When China announced the sanctions, countries such as Germany, Spain, and Italy began to fall into fear. Even some European countries, despite the EU's opposition, eagerly expressed their hope to negotiate with China in the hope of regaining this huge Chinese market.
