The film is a high-definition digital film with the theme of the Olympic Games. By describing the story of Wu Jie (played by Wu Yue), an ordinary martial arts coach in an amateur sports school, who diligently trained his students to participate in the Olympic Games, it shows the real and touching story of a small person. The inner world shows the ardent feelings of several generations of martial arts athletes for Chinese martial arts, as well as their warm hopes and hard work for martial arts to go to the Olympic Games.
