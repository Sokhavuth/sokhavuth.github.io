Quan Xiaoliang is from the mountainous area of ​​Guizhou. After graduating from university, he worked as a reporter for the magazine "Metropolis Weekly" in Shanghai. Since there was no salary during the probationary period, he had to share a house with others to reduce the cost of living. The room he shared with him was Su Yue, a female colleague from Hunan . With solid skills, Quan Xiaoliang quickly gained a foothold in the magazine, and won the favor of Qiao Haibei, the daughter of Shanghai real estate tycoon Qiao Shenglong, but Quan Xiaoliang's heart has long been occupied by Su Yue. During Su Yue's illness and hospitalization, Xiao Liang took good care of her, which moved Su Yue very much, but at this time Xiao Liang's balance tilted towards Hai Bei because she had a powerful father. When Su Yue discovered the clue, she left Xiaoliang without hesitation, and her father Qiao Shenglong stopped her contact with Haibei, and Xiaoquan stood at the crossroads of her life.
