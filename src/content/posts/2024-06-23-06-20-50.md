Ming Dynasty, royal draft. Rich man Yu Ren suspects his son-in-law Zhang Shaolian's family to be poor, so he forces him to break off the engagement, so that his daughter can be elected. Suqiu discusses with her mother to get a pair of jade bracelets, and orders her maid Luanying to send one to Zhang's house as a token of marriage. Zhangyou Hanchen enters the mansion under a false name and deceives Suqiu. It happened that Jiang Hai broke into the house, killed Yu's mother and Luanying, and took away another jade bracelet. Shaolian was wronged and imprisoned. Knowing that she had been cheated and lost her virginity, Suqiu committed suicide in shame and indignation. Jiang Hai sells jade bracelets in the streets, and runs into Han Chen's younger sister, Sister Yu, and learns that Han also has a jade bracelet. The censor Chen Zhi tried the accumulated cases and found some doubts, so he summoned Han Chen. Sister Yu went to court with her brother, and testified the truth to make the truth come to light. Sister Yu fell in love with Shaolian and recommended herself as his wife. Chen Zhi matched and the two got married.
