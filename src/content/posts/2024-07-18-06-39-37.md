American man Tom (played by James Alofs) married a Chinese girl Ling as his wife, and lived a life of dependence with Ling's mother, Mrs. Peng (played by Ge Zhaomei). The relationship between Tom and Ling has always been very good. Unfortunately, Ling died young, leaving only a sad husband and a desperate mother to depend on each other.
<br/><br/>
Ling's death took away all of Tom's hopes, until one day, at the exhibition site, Tom met a girl named Bobo. Bobo has a very similar appearance to Ling, which has become the main factor that attracts Tom, but with the deepening of understanding, Tom finds that Bobo and Ling have completely opposite personalities. Bobo is bold, unrestrained, informal, and exudes wild charm, which makes Tom feel irresistible. However, even though Tom pursues Bobo passionately, the latter remains unmoved.
