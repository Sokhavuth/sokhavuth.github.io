The story tells that in 1944, in order to protect a little girl with a secret message from the Soviet Union to attack the Japanese Kwantung Army, the underground organization of the Communist Party in Qingdao, "Beidou", launched a fierce life-and-death confrontation with the Japanese Gendarmerie, the Black Dragon Association, and the Military Command.
