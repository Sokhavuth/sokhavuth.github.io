The movie "Amei" is the first film in the world to be performed in Hakka language. It uses Hakka people's customs, old towns, folk songs, food and other cultural elements as the background to show the humanistic culture and folk customs of the Hakka people. It is also the first time to use the form of building a bridge between the Hakka people and the global Chinese.
