The summer vacation is coming to an end, but because of a promise to his father Li Linsen, 17-year-old Li Dongyang resolutely embarks on the road of following his father's footsteps regardless of his mother's opposition. The roads that his father walked, the places where his father lived and worked, the people his father dated, and the sonorous words of his father are presented in front of Li Dongyang one by one. He traveled through mountains and rivers, not only experienced a physical test, but also experienced a spiritual growth. Although the fact of his father's death cannot be changed, his sincerity and kindness and his unremitting pursuit of the meaning of life have left an indelible mark on Li Dongyang's heart.
