The story took place during the Ming Dynasty, when a bloody massacre shocked the capital. The only survivor in the tragedy was Caier (played by Wang Shasha), the daughter of rich man Zhou Kuifu (played by Min Zheng). Before dying, Zhou Kuifu gave Cai'er a willow whistle and asked her to join Wang Zhenwei (played by Zhou Qunda) of the World Bodyguard Bureau, hoping that Wang Zhenwei could escort Cai'er back to her hometown in Shanxi and reveal the truth of the incident to the family elders.

It turns out that the black hand behind all this is Cai'er's stepmother Yuguanyin (played by Meng Guangmei), and her so-called intention is to embezzle all of Zhou Kuifu's property. On the way, Cai'er luckily ran into Wang Zhenwei who was also going to Shanxi. Cai'er and her daughter disguised themselves as men, and the old and the young went together. Unexpectedly, there are constant dangers along the way, and the endless stream of assassins have pointed their finger at Cai'er. In the end, the two arrived at their destination smoothly, but they fell into another trap set by Yu Guanyin unexpectedly.
