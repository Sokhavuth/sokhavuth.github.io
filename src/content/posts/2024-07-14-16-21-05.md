When discussing China's aviation achievements, the spotlight often falls on the C919. However, it's impossible to overlook the global impact of China's ARJ21 aircraft. As of June this year, China has successfully delivered a third ARJ21 to Indonesia’s TransNusa—a deal notably conducted in RMB. In the first half of 2024 alone, China delivered 15 ARJ21 aircraft to various global airlines, with plans to reach 33 deliveries by year's end. This accelerated delivery pace and expanding market share are putting pressure on aviation giant Boeing. In today’s video, we delve into the unique aspects of the ARJ21 and analyze why more airlines are choosing it over the more publicized C919.

Historically, Boeing has dominated the global aviation market with its superbly designed and highly reliable aircraft. However, Boeing’s seeming invincibility was challenged when Airbus from France entered the scene, breaking its market monopoly. Over the subsequent five decades, Boeing and Airbus have shaped the industry landscape together. In the 21st century, as the global aviation market expanded and transportation demands grew, several countries began to challenge the Boeing-Airbus duopoly, including China.

In 2002, China officially announced its plan to develop its own civil aircraft, targeting mass production by 2009. By 2007, China's aviation industry had made significant progress, leading to the ARJ21’s first test flight in 2008. By 2015, the ARJ21 had secured its airworthiness certificate, allowing it to operate in the commercial market. Designed primarily for short-haul routes with a capacity of 90 passengers, the ARJ21 has become known for its strong performance in high-altitude operations and crosswind resistance, making it ideal for challenging conditions.

Compared to the C919, which competes with mainline jets like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, the ARJ21 serves a different market segment. Despite its smaller size and shorter range, the ARJ21 has garnered significant international recognition. Since its commercial introduction in November 2015, 128 ARJ21 aircraft have been delivered, accumulating over 360,000 flight hours and carrying more than 12 million passengers. Notable sales in 2024 include a significant order from Tibet Airlines and Congo Airways.

China’s aviation market rise poses a challenge to Boeing, which has faced safety concerns and geopolitical tensions affecting its production and sales. Meanwhile, the ARJ21 and C919 are steadily entering the market, with the C929 project aiming to compete in the wide-body market. With continuous investment and policy support, China’s aviation capabilities are set to challenge established players, signaling significant shifts in the global aviation landscape.
