At the end of Ming Dynasty and the beginning of Qing Dynasty, Wumei fled to Nan Shaolin because her father Wu Yitang offended the court dignitaries, and went to Nan Shaolin disciple Zhishan, her childhood playmate. In order to help Wumei save her father, Zhishan created the amazing "Yongchunquan". In the end, with the help of the monks of Nan Shaolin Temple and Zhishan, Wumei rescued her father.
