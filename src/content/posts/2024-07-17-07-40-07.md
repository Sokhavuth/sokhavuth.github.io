At the end of the Qing Dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, Jin Tian'er, who made a living by telling people's fortunes, was chased and beaten by Ga Zazi's hang Dabian'er because of his lies. Qi, inexplicably, became the head of the big man/chief bodyguard of this "rushing to the top of the mountain", and was forced to take over the job of escorting the emperor's bar; A ridiculous journey of desperation. During this journey of escorting Huang Gang, he escaped man-made pursuits again and again by mistake, not only saved the five major bodyguards but also gained his own growth.
