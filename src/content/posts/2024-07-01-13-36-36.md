After Princess Hanyang of the Southern Tang Dynasty died with hatred, she used the body of Ximenyan, the most beautiful woman in the south of the Yangtze River, to transform into a demon, and tried to become a fairy by seducing men in the world to absorb Yang energy. By chance, the scholar Wang Ziyu met a banshee, unable to resist her temptation, and abandoned his wife Chen Ying.
<br/><br/>
Chen Ying accidentally witnessed Ximenyan's true face, and realized that her husband was bewitched by a demon. If this continues, his life will be in danger. So, Chen Ying invited Chang Chengweng, an exorcist, and his apprentice Xiao Baozi, hoping that they could kill demons and save her husband from the misery. In this way, a war between transvestites is about to kick off.
