The film tells the story of Fang Xiaoqi, a ten-year-old boy who loves animals and is full of fantasy. Since his parents work outside the house all year round, he can only spend his childhood in the "Polar Ocean World" where his grandfather works. Fortunately, all kinds of marine animals in the "Sea World" filled Xiaoqi's life with joy and happiness.
<br/><br/>
One night, Xiao Qi was disappointed again by a letter from his father who was far away in the North Pole. The letter said that our scientific research work had not been completed yet, so we could not come back to celebrate your birthday. Xiaoqi was very sad, so he took his father's letter and went to the dolphin pool alone to cry secretly. At this moment, a miracle happened! The little dolphin Kiki, who was usually very close to Xiao Qi, suddenly started to 'talk' to him! It told Xiaoqi that it was also very sad and missed its father every day. Two hearts are closely linked because of the same emotion.
