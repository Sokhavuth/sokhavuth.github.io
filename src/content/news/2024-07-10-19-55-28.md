The Shuangjiangkou Hydropower Station, the world's tallest dam at 315 meters, under construction by China's Power Construction Hydropower No. 7 Bureau is nearing completion after 16 years of work, with 1.53 million cubic meters filled in April 2024 alone. Located on the Dadu River, the hydropower station, with an installed capacity of 2 million kilowatts, controls a basin area of 39,330 square kilometers and has a reservoir capacity of almost 3 billion cubic meters.

Despite delays due to financial and technical difficulties, groundbreaking formally began in 2015 and is expected to be operational by 2024. To combat weather conditions affecting dam filling, particularly in winter, the construction team implemented an airtight membrane storage area and a heliostats technology to maintain temperatures above freezing. Once operational, the dam is expected to reduce annual coal use by nearly 3 million tons and cut carbon dioxide emissions by over 7 million tons.
The Shuangjiangkou Hydropower Station is a testament to China's capabilities in building ultra-high dams and emphasizes its leading role in new energy usage worldwide.
