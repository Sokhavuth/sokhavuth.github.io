In Asia, China is known for its amazing infrastructure construction capabilities and has earned the nickname "Infrastructure Maniac". The country has one of the most complete and advanced transportation networks in the world, making it one of the world's leaders in infrastructure construction.
<br/><br/>
By the end of 2023, China's total operating railway mileage reached an impressive 159,000 kilometers, of which high-speed railways reached 45,000 kilometers. And China's strong infrastructure capabilities have also attracted cooperation intentions from many countries.
<br/><br/>
On June 25 this year, the President of Peru paid a five-day state visit to China. During this period, Peruvian officials introduced to China six major railway projects currently underway, with a total investment of more than $31 billion.
<br/><br/>
Peru hopes to learn from China's advanced technology and experience in railways to jointly promote the construction of these railway projects. If the cooperation can be achieved, it will further strengthen China's influence in South America, which is the biggest concern of the United States.
<br/><br/>
So why does Peru trust China so much? How important are the six railways worth $31 billion?
